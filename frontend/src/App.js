      A reverse proxy is the recommended method to expose an application server to the internet. Whether you are running a Node.js application in production or a minimal built-in web server with Flask, these application servers will often bind to localhost with a TCP port. This means by default, your application will only be accessible locally on the machine it resides on. While you can specify a different bind point to force access through the internet, these application servers are designed to be served from behind a reverse proxy in production environments. This provides security benefits in isolating the application server from direct internet access, the ability to centralize firewall protection, and a minimized attack plane for common threats such as denial of service attacks.

From a client’s perspective, interacting with a reverse proxy is no different from interacting with the application server directly. It is functionally the same, and the client cannot tell the difference. A client requests a resource and then receives it, without any extra configuration required by the client.

This tutorial will demonstrate how to set up a reverse proxy using Nginx, a popular web server and reverse proxy solution. You will install Nginx, configure it as a reverse proxy using the proxy_pass directive, and forward the appropriate headers from your client’s request. If you don’t have an application server on hand to test, you will optionally set up a test application with the WSGI server Gunicorn.
